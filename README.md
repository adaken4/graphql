# Zone01 Kisumu Profile Web App

A personal profile web application built with **React** that fetches and displays my progress data from the [Zone01 Kisumu GraphQL API](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is part of my learning journey at **Zone01 Kisumu**.  
The goal is to practice working with **GraphQL, JWT authentication, and React**, while also applying **UI/UX principles** to build a usable profile dashboard.

The app allows me to:

- Log in with my **Zone01 credentials** (username/email + password).  
- Fetch my own data securely using the GraphQL API with a JWT token.  
- View key information about my progress, such as:
  - XP earned
  - Grades
  - Audit ratios
  - Skills  
- Visualize progress with **SVG-based statistic graphs** (at least two different types).  
- Log out safely.

## 📊 Features

- **Authentication**: Login & logout with JWT.  
- **GraphQL Queries**: Simple, nested, and argument-based queries.  
- **Profile Dashboard**: Displays my data in a clean UI.  
- **Statistic Graphs**: SVG graphs for XP over time, project results, etc.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Netlify/GitHub Pages (TBD).
